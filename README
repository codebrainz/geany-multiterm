Multi-Tabbed Terminal plugin for Geany
--------------------------------------

It's working OK but with very limited features so far.

After checkout run `autogen.sh' to prepare the build system.

To install, use the usual:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

Once enabled in Geany's Plugin Manager, a new tab will be created in the
message window area.

Enjoy
