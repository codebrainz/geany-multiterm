Geany MultiTerm Plugin
======================

## MultiTerm source has moved!

The [MultiTerm][mt] plugin is now part of the [Geany-Plugins][gp]
project and the latest source is hosted there. You can find the
latest `master` branch of this old repository by checking out the
[`old-master`][om] branch.

Feel free to still use the [Issue tracker][it] here to report issues
with the main plugin in the [Geany-Plugins][gp] project, it doesn't
have the [Github Issue tracker][GP] activated at the time of writing.
